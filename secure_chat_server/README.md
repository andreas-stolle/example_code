# Secure Chat Server (C)

A secure client–server chat application implemented in C with a focus on secure programming practices, explicit memory management, and robust handling of untrusted input.

The project explores low-level networking, authentication, and cryptographic integration in a resource-constrained environment.

The system follows a classic client–server architecture, with a central server managing connections and message routing between authenticated clients. Communication is designed to protect confidentiality and integrity, even in the presence of malformed or malicious input.
